# Detection Model Training Guide

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ú® Getting Started: Data Collection</strong></summary>

### **How to Collect and Prepare Good Data**

1. **Consistency Is Key**
   - Ensure your images reflect the kind of inputs you'll get during real-world inference (lighting, resolution, angle).

2. **Diverse Scenarios**
   - Vary lighting, background, and orientation.
   - Include challenging edge cases.

3. **Avoid Data Noise**
   - Blurry or misaligned labels reduce performance.
   - Consistent labeling format is critical.

4. **Balanced Dataset**
   - Collect an equal number of samples for each class (as much as possible).

5. **Recommended Tools**
   - Mobile cameras, microscopes, digital cameras

<summary><strong>üì∑ Data Collection</strong></summary>

1. Sign in to [**Roboflow**](https://roboflow.com/) and click **New Project**.
2. Choose a project type:
   - **Classification**: Identify which category an image belongs to.
   - **Object Detection**: Draw bounding boxes.
   - **Keypoint Detection**: Label keypoints (like joints).
3. Upload and label your dataset:
   - Use **bounding boxes** for detection
   - Use **point annotations** for keypoints
4. Click **Generate** to preprocess:
   - Resize to `416x416`
   - Auto-orient images
5. Use a **train/valid/test** split:
   - Suggested: 70% Train / 20% Valid / 10% Test
6. Export as **Pascal VOC** (or your model format)

<summary><strong>üéì Classification Training</strong></summary>

- Choose **Classification** when uploading to Roboflow.
- Export your dataset in **Image Classification** format.
- Use common models like MobileNet, EfficientNet.
- Train using Roboflow or transfer dataset to your own PyTorch/TensorFlow environment.

Example with PyTorch:
```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

data = datasets.ImageFolder("/path/to/data", transform=transforms.ToTensor())
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìä Object Detection Training</strong></summary>

- Select **Object Detection** as project type
- Label bounding boxes
- Export in **Pascal VOC** or **YOLO** format

Colab Example (YOLOv4):
```python
!pip install roboflow
from roboflow import Roboflow
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
project = rf.workspace("YOUR_WORKSPACE").project("YOUR_PROJECT")
version = project.version(1)
dataset = version.download("darknet")
```
- Use with YOLOv4 or YOLOX notebooks to train

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üßë‚Äçüîß Keypoint Detection Training</strong></summary>

- Select **Keypoint Detection** on Roboflow
- Label keypoints on each object (e.g., tip, base, joint)
- Export in COCO JSON or other supported format

Training Tips:
- Use lightweight models like RTMPose, HRNet, or SimplePose
- Convert labels to COCO format for compatibility

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Inference and Deployment</strong></summary>

1. Use the same image size during inference as during training.
2. Normalize and preprocess images exactly as in training.
3. Make sure inference environment matches (hardware, dependencies).
4. Use ONNX, TensorRT, or NCNN for edge deployment.
